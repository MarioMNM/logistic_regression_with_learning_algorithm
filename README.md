# Logistic Regression with Learning Algorithm<br>
This is a logistic regression model that works with a learning algorithm that is the basis for training neural networks.<br>
This model classifies images according to whether they are of cats or not.<br>
The general architecture of a learning algorithm is:<br>
* Initializing parameters<br>
* Calculating the cost function and its gradient<br>
* Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent)<br>

Where the cost function is defined as $$J = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (y^{(i)}\log(a^{(i)})+(1-y^{(i)})\log(1-a^{(i)}))$$
